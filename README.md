# My Shell Environment

Customizing one's shell is really amazing, but you quickly go into the hell of config files, symlinks and dependencies.

This is my attempt to create a light modular environment, that I can use on any machine just by cloning this repo.

It consists mainly of my vim, bash and inputrc config.

You can't use it if you don't have vim, git or bash installed (but in that case you may be on another planet ...)


## installation:
```
git clone https://github.io/rambip/shell-environment .config/shell
```

and add to your .bashrc:
```
source $HOME/.config/shell/bashrc
```


## TODO
- port bash script (create projects and so on) to pyhton ?

### fun ideas to add:

 - Killer Sheep : game
 - DrawIt : draw ascii diagrams
